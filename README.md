## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort by our team to design and implement a high-tech, eco-friendly water management system for a greenhouse on our campus. The goal is to maximize the use of natural resources, such as rainwater, and create a sustainable, automated system that ensures the optimal growth environment for plants while minimizing water waste.

## Key Features:
* Rainwater Collection & Filtration: The system captures rainwater from the greenhouse roof, filters out debris (such as sand, dirt, and leaves), and stores it in a reservoir for use in watering the plants.

* Nutrient and Mineral Monitoring: Sensors continuously monitor the water quality, including its mineral and nutrient levels. The system automatically assesses whether additional nutrients need to be added to 
  support healthy plant growth.

* pH Level Monitoring: The pH value of the water is crucial for plant health. Our system checks the pH level and sends alerts to users if adjustments are required to maintain the ideal range for plant growth.

* Reservoir Level Detection: The system includes sensors to track the water level in the reservoir. It can detect when the reservoir is nearly full or nearly empty. To prevent running out 
  of water.

* Smart Watering Schedule: The system integrates weather forecast data to optimize water usage. It ensures plants are watered when needed, but only if there’s enough water in the reservoir or if rain is 
  expected soon. This prevents overwatering and conserves resources.

* User Notifications: Whenever the system detects an issue, such as a low water level, a nutrient imbalance, or an out-of-range pH level, it will automatically send alerts to the users so timely actions can 
  be taken.

## Why This Project Matters
Our goal is to create a sustainable, automated greenhouse that not only minimizes water waste but also ensures that plants receive the exact amount of water and nutrients they need. By using rainwater and optimizing its use based on weather forecasts, we are aligning this project with the campus’s green initiatives.

This project will serve as a model for future greenhouse installations, providing both environmental and educational value. It demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to create efficient and sustainable agriculture systems in an urban setting.
